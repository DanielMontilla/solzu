# Solzu
A collection of useful typescript functions, types and classes. Got tired of copy pasting stuff between projects ðŸ˜¬

## Features
- Rust inspired `Result` & `Option` types
- `defineOptions` flexible utility to generate orderless named function parameters.
- general math stuff like `randomElementFrom` randomly pick element of array or object.
