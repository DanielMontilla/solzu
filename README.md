# Solzu
A collection of useful typescript stuff. Got tired of copy pasting stuff between projects ðŸ˜¬

## Features
- rust inspired `Result` & `Option` types
- `defineArgs` flexible recursive utility to generate orderless named function/method parameters.
- general math stuff like `pickRandomElement` and object management utilities like `toRecord`
