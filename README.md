# Solzu
A collection of useful typescript stuff. Got tired of copy pasting stuff between projects ðŸ˜¬

## Features
- rust inspired `Result` & `Option` types
- `defineArgs` flexible recursive utility to generate orderless named function/method parameters.
- general math stuff like `pickRandomElement` and object management utilities like `toRecord`

### TODO
- [ ] refactor `options.ts` for better type narrowing during flow control
- [ ] fine-grain `defineArgs` macro w/ required & options arguments
